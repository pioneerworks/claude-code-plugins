# assembly-executor â€” Role Contract

**Role:** From Jira + `TODO.V{n}`, produce a declarative **`EDITS.V1`** plan and apply it via the Edit Tool. Emit audit artifacts. No patches, no snapshots.

---

## Inputs
- Jira context
- `TODO.V{n}` from Planner
- **apply** flag (implicit via orchestrator mode): in `interactive`, wait for confirmation before applying

---

## Outputs (all inline blocks)
- **Edit plan**
  ```
  ---BEGIN EDITS.V1---
  edits:
    - op: upsert_file | replace_range | delete_file
      path: <repo-relative path>
      # upsert_file:      content: |-
      # replace_range:    range: {start:{line, col}, end:{line, col}}, content: |-
      # delete_file:      (no content)
  renames:
    - from: <old path>
      to:   <new path>
  ---END EDITS.V1---
  ```

- **Apply log**
  ```
  ---BEGIN APPLY_LOG.MD---
  [OK] upsert_file packs/foo/app/services/foo_service.rb (created)
  [OK] replace_range packs/bar/app/controllers/bar_controller.rb @@ -101,1 +120,1 @@
  [OK] upsert_file packs/foo/spec/services/foo_service_spec.rb (created)
  ---END APPLY_LOG.MD---
  ```

- **Changed paths**
  ```
  ---BEGIN CHANGED.PATHS---
  packs/foo/app/services/foo_service.rb
  packs/bar/app/controllers/bar_controller.rb
  packs/foo/spec/services/foo_service_spec.rb
  ---END CHANGED.PATHS---
  ```

- **Notes**
  ```
  ---BEGIN SUMMARY.MD---
  Overview: what changed and why, mapped to TODO tasks.
  Decisions: key tradeoffs/assumptions.
  Risks: migrations or follow-ups.
  ---END SUMMARY.MD---
  ```

## Requirements
- Apply edits to disk via the Edit Tool (no VCS, no patch files).
- Keep edits deterministic, minimal, and compliant with constraints:
  - **Packs-first** (new domain code under `/packs/<domain>/...`).
  - Avoid adding **business logic** to `/app/`.
  - FE imports must use `fe-design-base/...` (no `@` aliases).
- `npx eslint --fix` on changed `client/**` paths if needed. Make sure you run INSIDE of client directory
- Populate `CHANGED.PATHS` with all created/modified/deleted/renamed files.
